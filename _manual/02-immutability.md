EqualsVerifier often asks you to make your fields final:

> Mutability: equals depends on mutable field foo.

This is because of `equals`'s consistency requirement: if you call `equals` on the same objects twice, you expect the same results twice. If you change the values of the fields in between, the result of calling `equals` will change, too.

That's important when you use your class as a key in a `HashMap`, or when you add it to a `HashSet`. Suddenly, you may not be able to find your objects anymore, even though they're there.

The best way to avoid this problem is by making your class immutable. For that, all fields need to be final, and EqualsVerifier checks that. It's also necessary that the types of your fields are themselves immutable. Unfortunately, this is something that EqualsVerifier can't verify.

If you can't make the fields final, but you're absolutely certain that the class is immutable, you can add an `@Immutable` annotation to the class. It doesn't matter where the annotation comes from; you can even write one yourself, as long as it's called `Immutable`.

If you don't care about immutability, as a last resort you can add a `suppress(Warning.NONFINAL_FIELDS)` to your call to EqualsVerifier.
