Have you ever written an `equals` method, along with five screens of unit tests to test it? Or worse: not bothered to test it at all, because "the IDE generates it anyway"?

EqualsVerifier helps you. Testing `equals` can be as simple as:

{% highlight java %}
@Test
public void equalsContract() {
    EqualsVerifier.forClass(Foo.class).verify();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And EqualsVerifier even gives you 100% coverage on `equals` and `hashCode` methods.


Sounds great, how do I use it?
